# Human-Resources-Retention
**Purpose** : To predict which employee will leave based on our dataset.

**Dataset** : 15000 rows and 9 columns.

**Features Details** - Contains employee details like employee id, number of projects, time spend in the company, work accident, left(target feature), promotion last years, department and salary.

**Numeric data** -  Number of projects, time spend in the company, work accident,  left(target feature), promotion last years.

**Categorical Data** - department and salary. 

**Machine leaning Algorithims used** - Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifer.

_Note: Have also used Deep Learning(activation functions - sigmoid and relu along with adam opimizer);_

**Results -**

**1. Logistic Regression -**

**Conclusion -**

Random Forest Classifier gives us the maximum accuracy of 98.78%. The accuracy of deep learning model is not as high as that of random forest classifier. To make it go that high we can play around with our deep neural network model, by maybe adding a few more hidden layers, etc.
